# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive Python-based **Pathfinding Visualizer** using Pygame. This tool demonstrates two popular pathfinding algorithms:  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  

The grid allows users to set a start node, end node, and obstacles while visualizing the algorithm in action.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**:  
  - Left-click to set start, end, and obstacle nodes.  
  - Right-click to reset nodes.  
- **Visualization**:  
  - BFS guarantees the shortest path.  
  - DFS explores depth-first but may not find the shortest path.  
- **Live Metrics**: Displays step counts and shortest path length.
